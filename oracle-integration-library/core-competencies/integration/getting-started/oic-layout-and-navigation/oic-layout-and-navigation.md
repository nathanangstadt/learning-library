# Oracle Integration Layout and Navigation

## Introduction

In this section we will cover the basic layout of the Oracle Integration product, the navigation scheme, and some common icon terminology we will use throughout the rest of the workshop.

## Home page

When you sign in to Oracle Integration, the Home page opens. From here, you can navigate
to the product features you want, view a mini dashboard of relevant metrics and status, and
link directly to your current tasks, applications, and work in progress.

### Try an Integration Recipe or a Process QuickStart

The Try a Recipe banner at the top of the Home page showcases an integration recipe for employee onboarding and a QuickStart App for a travel approval process.

These two prebuilt solutions are from the extensive collection of recipes, accelerators, QuickStart Apps, and samples included in Oracle Integration. You can use any available prebuilt solution to get a head start in building integrations or process applications instead of creating them from scratch.

However, it's not your only option. At any time, you can click the Navigation Menu icon in the top-left corner of the Home page to access all pages, tools, dashboards, and settings. |

## Navigation

Use the navigation pane to get access to all the pages, tools, dashboards, and settings in Oracle Integration.

When you start Oracle Integration, the navigation pane is hidden. To view the navigation pane, click the Navigation Menu icon in the top-left corner of the Home page.

![Navigate](./images/show-hide-nav-menu.png "")

The menu displayed in the navigation pane depends on your assigned role, your selection, and your location in Oracle Integration. The navigation pane may display the main menu or a sub-menu, such as the one for Integrations.
